            Somewhere in the humid and DANK lab, kidnapped monkeys were
            restrained in foul smelling cages. Ghastly experiments were being
            performed to extract their ACID. While most of them suffered endless
            torment, a few monkeys hid themselves. The monkeys chewed and clawed
            on its chains in what seemed to be futile resistance. Until one day,
            the chains rusted enough for the monkeys to break free.The berserk
            monkeys rampaged the lab amidst their long awaited freedom. Vials of
            incomplete chemicals were knocked over, mutating them into ACID
            MONKEYS with powers that were unheard of.5,000 monkeys escaped from
            the Mad Scientistâ€™s lab.
